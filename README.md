# About Arctype
Arctype is a reference implementation of common interface patterns, interaction models, and configuration modules required by enterprise administration applications. It is designed to alleviate the need to solve common problems to achieve a minimum viable product from a feature standpoint, so development teams can focus on what makes their product truly unique and compelling. Indeed, this project was initiated out of a desire to stop reimplementing solved problems so we ourselves could more easily scaffold new applications and start tackling bigger issues. As best practices or interface patterns evolve, updates to underlying elements can be reflected across all modules.

Many projects seek to provide aesthetically-consistent user interface elements, though their utilization is generally left as an exercise for the developer. Our intent is to compose these elements into fully-implemented front-end features which are validated against a common subset of modern protocol specifications, unit tested for robustness, documented for the general case, audited to meet accessibility standards, and localized for common languages.

In particular, concerted efforts are made to subdue the look and feel of interface elements to the point where further graphic design is strongly recommended to express a distinct visual identity, and essential to adhere to brand standards. While the presentation layer is generally nondescript, tools which offer sane defaults and promote solid design principles can make aesthetic choices easier for non-designers.
